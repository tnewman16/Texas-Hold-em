# Texas-Hold-em

A Texas Hold'em game to be played with multiple people implemented with JavaFX.

This project was created for Computer Science 221 at the College of Charleston
during the Fall 2015 semester.

To run the game, make sure you have both Java (version 8) and JavaFX installed.
The only file needed to run this is the Jar file located in Poker_FX_jar/.
Just run "java -jar Poker\ FX.jar" on the Poker FX.jar file.
